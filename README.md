# To Do List Application

The **To Do List Application** is a redesign of my original Task Management List. It is a fully functional to-do list app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The program allows users to manage tasks with advanced features such as task prioritization, due dates, and the ability to store tasks using **local storage** so that tasks remain even after closing the browser.

## Project Overview

The To Do List Application enables users to:

- **Add New Tasks**: Input tasks into the list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify task details after they've been added.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove individual tasks from the list.
- **Task Prioritization**: Move tasks to the top to mark them as high-priority.
- **Set Due Dates**: Assign deadlines to tasks for better organization.
- **Clear All Tasks**: Easily remove all tasks if needed.
- **Organize Tasks**: Tasks are categorized into three sections:
  - **All**: Displays all tasks (default view).
  - **Pending**: Displays tasks that are not yet completed.
  - **Completed**: Displays tasks that have been marked as completed.
- **Task Movement**: When a task is marked as completed via a checkbox, it automatically moves to the Completed column, while the remaining tasks are in Pending.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored using local storage, so they persist even when the page is refreshed or closed.

## Features

- **Interactive Task List**: Powered by JavaScript for adding, editing, deleting, and prioritizing tasks.
- **Three-Column Layout**: Tasks are categorized into three views: All, Pending, and Completed.
- **Task Priority**: Users can move tasks to the top of the list to mark them as high priority.
- **Due Dates**: Users can assign due dates to tasks for better tracking.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks remain stored in the browser even after the user exits the application.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, task management, and local storage functionality.
